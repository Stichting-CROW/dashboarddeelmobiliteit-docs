To start using the API you first need to get an API key from the Dashboard. An API key is a long random string that functions as a kind of password. If you create an API-key be mindful with where you store it.

## How to get an API key?

1. [Login](https://dashboarddeelmobiliteit.nl/login) in to the Dashboard Deelmobiliteit
2. Click the configuration button to go to your [Profile](https://dashboarddeelmobiliteit.nl/profile)
3. Click the [API keys](https://dashboarddeelmobiliteit.nl/profile/api) tab
4. Click **Nieuwe API key**

In the API key list a new API key appears, for you to use.

## How to delete an API key?

1. Go to the [API keys](https://dashboarddeelmobiliteit.nl/profile/api)
2. Next to the API key you'd like to delete, click the _trash bin_ icon

The API key is deleted now.
